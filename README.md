# WiFuck

Easily find paswords for Cyta networks. :wink:

###Help
Complete the box with a wifi name of a Thomson, Speedtouch or CYTA network. For example if the wifi name is Thomson `AF4BEE`, then you have to input `AF4BEE` same for Speedtouch and CYTA wifi. Wait... and potential passwords will pop.
